## Description
This project was made for people who would like simplistic three character logos. Making this project I got a deeper understanding of classes and how to implement them into my code. Using tests was a big part of my project I tested all of my classes - more information in the tests section.
Using the tests overall made my coding journey alot different but a great experience none the less.
